<h2  align="left">About the project :robot::mechanical_arm::car:</h2>

###

<p align="left"> This project was a competition in which we were requested to build a robot arm car to pick pingpong balls and drop them in a storage as fast as possible.
<p align="left"> We used a tube as our end effector, since we believed it was more convenient to pick several balls in one run. Also to avoid creating a storage system within our robot, adding weight and more electrical components.
<p align="left"> Mecanum wheels were used to allow the robot to rotate in its own axis, facilitating the movement.
<p align="left"> The arm and end effector were made completely using a 3D-printing, while the base was made of acrylic which was cut using a laser cutting machine.

###

<p align="left"> The code parameteres are according to the project purpose needs, use them as a reference.
<p align="left"> Some parts of the codes were extracted from existing codes about related topics online and were integrated with our own lines of codes, in order to meet our specific requirements.
